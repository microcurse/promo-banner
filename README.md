# promo-banner
This simple WordPress plugin will display a promo banner at the top of the page or below the main navigation.

There should be an interface within the admin to input text. This banner should be globally controlled and not controlled per page.

User should be able to enable/disable the banner based on category page. 

Things to consider:

- Should there be a shortcode to paste in for each page?
- Should there be a toggle to display or hide it per category page?
- Should the promo banner display on categories based on a hard coded category ID?
- Should it be coded into a specific page template so that we can assign it to specific pages?
